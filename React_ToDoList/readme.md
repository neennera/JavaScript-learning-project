**todo list website**

This project aimed to develop a platform that is both user-friendly and efficient for task management and daily activity organization. Users are able to create, edit, and delete tasks on the website. Additionally, a progress bar is implemented to help users track their task completion.

In this website, my main focus was to utilize my React skills that I had acquired. Firstly, I transformed each element of the website, such as the to-do item, add and edit bar, and live clock, into separate React components. This approach allowed for easy reusability and independent rendering. To track variables like the array of to-do list items, time in the live clock, and progress bar, I used React's useState and useEffect hooks. Lastly, I learned to utilize props to pass values and functions between parent and child components.

For the front-end development, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simplistic and responsive user interface. The website design was centered around providing a clean and intuitive user experience.
